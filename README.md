# DC-Motor-Driver-Circuit
A motor driver circuit which is able to control the speed and direction of a DC motor. 
The H-Bridge is responsible for the direction control, it uses 4 transistors to accomplish this in a fairly simple manner.
The PWM function generator is responsible for the generating the square function (AC voltage source required to drive DC motor)
The Optical Encoder is used to determine the speed of the DC motor
